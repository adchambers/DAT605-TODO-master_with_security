* **Project Description**
<br>As part of National University's Web and Cloud Computing (DAT605) course curriculum, students demonstrate their ability to develop and implement web applications.  In this instance, group members have engineered a Java-based RESTful (Representational State Transfer) web service utilizing Spring Boot as the project's framework.  Maintaining traditional REST practices, resources are manipulated using HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) methods: GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE.  These entries are then displayed as JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) and are secured with Spring-based authentication and access control.  Lastly, the application is deployed to Google App Engine platform.
